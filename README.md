* Try to keep as simple as possible.
* Encourage fast move by introducing dangerous cells.
* Could use multi-cell as one to imporve UI.

* Use buffer command to move between stairs.
* Create maze only surounded could be seen
* How about introducing a shadow, who is more flexable.
* There must be a good story about shadow.
